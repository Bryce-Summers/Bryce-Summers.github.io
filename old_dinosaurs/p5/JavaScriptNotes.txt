Note on Java Script Problems by Bryce Summers.
----------------------------------------------


Javascript does not really allow multiple functions with the same name, but different type signatures. This is rather annoying.

Although javascript does not send off syntax errors immediatly, it is programmer friendly enough for my to make progress.


Javascript does not use integer division!!! Beware the omniprescience of floating point numbers and use the Math.floor() function.

Javascript does not like loading images when run locally, but it is fine when it runs them on the internet.

Javascript does not mandate strict sytax checking, so if something works differently locally and on the internet, then it is probably due to a missing parentheses or something that is interpretted differently.

Pass Functions as call(foo); instead of call(foo()); The parenteses evaluate the function, which is not what is desired.
