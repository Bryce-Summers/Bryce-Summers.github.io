<h1><a href="www.brycesummers.com" ></a> Bryce's Inspirational Likography</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class='description'>

This is my personal likography of people, ideas, etc, that I like and/or those
that inspire me. This page geared towards my professional interests, rather than
my more personal interests. As such, I have omitted countless family members and friends who
I like and who inspire me. Achtung! note that all descriptions here are <b>entirely subjective</b>
and reflect the interpretations of Bryce Summers.
