<h3> What Transpired</h3>
<div class='description'>
During the Fall 2015 iteration of 15-462,
I was a member of a <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015/courseinfo">team</a> of people that reinvented the Introduction to Computer Graphics course at Carnegie Mellon University from the ground up.
Here is a <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015/home">link</a> to the course webpage.

<h3>My Contributions</h3>

<div class='text_no_indent'>
<!--<div class='description'> -->

I led the development of a student assignment about mesh proccessing called <a href="http://462cmu.github.io/asst2_meshedit/"> meshEdit</a>.
<br>
I also led the development of an assignment about writing a <a href="http://462cmu.github.io/asst4_animation/">key frame animation program</a>.
<br>
I contributed Options G and H for the <a href="">5th assignment</a>, where we let the students choose their own final projects. My options involved Iterated function Systems and 2D Fluence Rendering.
<br>
I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/Writings/blob/master/Programming%20Guides/C_plus_plus_guide.pdf">C++ Programming Guide</a> to help those students who were writing c++ for the first time.
<br>
I held weekly office hours, wrote comments on the course webpage, and met with students one-on-one by appointment.
