Dice Cycles is a Game that I invented back in 2012 based on the light cycles game in the Tron movies and my interest in creating random boards through dice.
This is a toy program that provides the representational capabilities to play a game of DiceCycles.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<div class='description'>
<ul>
  <li> A 10 by 10 board is randomly generated by putting randomly oriented dice at every location.
  <li> Both players choose distinct starting location by marking one of the locations. This location becomes their current location.
  <li> Every turn, players must make a number of moves equal to the number on the dice of the current location at the beginning of the turn.
  <li> -- Moves must be 1 square up, left, right, or down from their current location. Once moved, the player marks the location and it becomes their current location.
  <li> -- Players may not move to locations that have already been marked.
  <li> -- Players may not move out of the bounds of the board.
  <li> Turns procceed in clockwise order.
  <li> A player loses if they cannot make a valid move.
</ul>
