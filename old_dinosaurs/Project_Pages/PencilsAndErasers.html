I used the pencils and erasers that I had used for the first two years of college and created an art project consisting of a sculpture that seeks to tell a metephorical story of the
relationships a group of individuals may have during their lives.
Much like the use and decay of the pencils,
we all use our personal writing heads to enact changes on the world,
we use our personal erasers to try to overcome some actions that we perceive to be mistakes.
