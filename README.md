# Academic Assignment Repository
[Website Link](https://bryce-summers.github.io/AcademicAssignmentsSite/)

This is a repository dedicated to collecting my various media production artifacts for
the academic courses that I am taking and to provide links and electronic formatting to them
that would not necessarily be availible in a simple folder structure, such as on Google Drive.
