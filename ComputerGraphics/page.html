<h1>ICBL - Computer Graphics</h1>
<h3>Directed by Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>
We seek to make the mathematical theory and pragmatic application of the field of Computer Graphics as accessible as possible, especially for motivated people who find reading the traditional literature to be frustrating. <br>Symbiotically, we seek to develop new algorithms and tools to enable people to express their Computer Graphics understandings and utilize more of the knowledge from the field, such as the use of Halfedge data structures. Please see the the <a href="../ICBL_info_pages/philosophy.html"> philosophy</a> page for more information our educational theories.

<td>The Bryce Data Structures Library is a collection of useful algorithms and data structures for interactive visual work on the internet. It is used in quite just about all of my recent work. It is useful to me, because it allows me to have a high degree of control when doing Computational Geometry in Javascript.</td>

</td>
<td>In collaboration with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/">Keenan Crane</a>, we've been working towards developing algorithms for extracting useful SVG friendly curves from geometry representations. This work is meant to bridge a feature gap between 3D modeling programs and 2D illustration programs. Thus far, we've found some practical solutions to finding sillouette curves. [Image belongs to Keenan Crane.] Bryce has planned to spend time during the Summer of 2017 continuing this work.

<td>
This was one of my first tool design projects. This was an ambitious attempt to improve the lives of linear algebra students through a tool that allowed them to easily perform macroscopic operations like row reducing instead of performing arithmetic. <br><br>

I stopped working on it in the Fall of 2013, because I realized that I needed to aquire a lot more background knowledge on designing programs for people and I needed to start writing programs that work on the internet, because writing programs for desktops is becoming outdated for tools like the ones that I am making.
