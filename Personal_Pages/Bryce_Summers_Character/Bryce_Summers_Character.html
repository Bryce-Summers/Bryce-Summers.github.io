<h1><a href="www.brycesummers.com" ></a> Bryce's Self-Characterization</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class='description'>
As our personalities don't conform perfectly with ideals and we are all on spectrums,
I may state some extreme things here, such as not liking small talk and any rational person will notice this universal quantification and then
proceed to quietly lie in wait observing me until they see a contradiction and can therefore prove my writing to me non-sensical. Therefore I would
like to explicitly point out that these are statements of my ideals and visions of myself, rather than the actual faulty person who you may interact with in your life.
Such self-characterization is inherently outdated by my own daily changes in character and represents ideas that I currently believe myself strongly aligned with, rather than
representing a perfect account of how I will think and act in a given situation. I tend to act based on the situation and my own contemporary thinking,
rather than ideas and actions that I have revealed to the world in the past. My life is not lived according to precedent, where my past descisions fully determine those of the present as is followed by practitioners of American law.
I tried living under a belief in precedant, but found it to be unpleasant and unhealthy, because it supported such ideas as, "If I express my desire to enter into a relationship with 
another human being and they reject me, then I can never express such a desire to another human being, for fear of contradicting myself and proving one of the statements to be false."
This is the idea that people are dynamic and are capable of changing their beliefs in the presense of new information through life experience.

This writing will probably get stale and it is here primarily to remind myself of who I think that I am and allowing me to get closer to the truth. You may also have other opinions and 
it may be helpful for you to see the disconnect between our repective perspectives on my character and perhaps fuel some good quality debate.
</div>

<h2>Hapiness</h2>
<div class='description'>
I derive happiness from experiencing a well communicated story meant for humans,
whether through musical performance, visual narrative, intellectual argument, or openminded truth seeking conversation.<br>
I enjoy talking about ideas and ideals, rather than facts, and non-constructive small talk. In other words, I am an intelletual.
Being an intellectual has nothing to do with intelligence,
much like being a chess player has nothing to do with intelligence. An intellectual is a person who enjoys thinking and living in their mind in the realm of ideas,
regardless of the quality of such musings. A chess player is just someone who enjoys playing chess, regardless of their reletive skill.
</div>

<h2>Desire</h2>
<div class='description'>
I desire to give back to the world in the mediums that have brought me happiness
</div>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<div class='description'>
I find learning to be difficult and that the standard narratives and modes of disseminating information are lacking.
There is a lot of pain that students of all ages have to go through to achieve their learning goals and I don't think their path is as clear as possible.
I believe that through better design and a better coorelation between the modes of expression and the expressed ideas,
our society can disseminate information in a more humane, efficient, and emotionally satisfying manner. I also believe that the ideal teaching includes enourmous amounts of preparation and that teaching needs to be a priority. If a person cares more about their own self betterment and personal affairs than teaching,
then I believe that they should refrain from teaching until such a time when they are willing to put in the love and care needed to inspire students.
</div>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<div class='description'>
Information has to be represented within a structured form, or else it cannot be properly retrieved. Structure is where reasoning and logic come into life. Structure entails 
capabilities, understanding, and efficiency. I have developed a strong appreciation for structure through my journey in the field of Computer Science.
</div>

<h2>Design and Style</h2>
<div class='description'>
Although information is understood through structure once it is firmly, unambiguously, and properly within a knowledge repository, such as a human brain or a computer system,
I believe that in order to communicate new information, we must appeal to the senses of the human existence. Proper design smooths out and guides
the human mind to see the signal from the noise in our world that is full of contextually irrelevant details and ideas. A person or program knows what they can do, but their
audience is liable to misunderstand them at every point in the proccess. If the communicator realizes that a miscommunication has occured they can provide more details in an interactive
process that is akin to binary searching the space of all possible understandings. Most often, this process is infeasible, due in part by the ambiguity of converstational language.
Design and Style helps delineate the concepts and applys mappings between the information and what the learner already understands. I developed an appreciation for design and style
after early attempts to communicate the beauty of structure to others. I found that no matter how correct 
one of my ideas might seem to me, it is important to frame it through the lens of good style if I want to effectively communicate it to someone with the intent of allowing for them
to come to their own conclusions, after understanding the idea and my reosoning in support of the idea.
</div>

<h2>Decoration</h2>
<div class='description'>
Decoration has to do with individualism and how any particular person will have biases and preferences based on their personality and life experiences.
A person may live in a structurally sound house that doesn't fall down, but the structural integrity and geometric partitioning of space won't appeal to them unless they 
are very in tune with and appreciative of rational or philisophical models for the notion of a home. At the next level, the house may be well designed, in that the person
is able to discern culturally engrained features such as doors, door knobs, kitchens, bathrooms, etc, which make their affordances and capabilities apparent to the person
in a way that allows for the person to develop an intuitive mental model of how to utilize the house. The design level empowers the person, but doens't provide familiarity and
comfort to the person. Emotional stability and contentment come from the level of decoration. The person wants to feel some agency over their home and wants to be around some objects
and design descisions that are directly linked and to their existence, such as the presence of stuffed bunny rabbits bought by their grandmother, paintings of lovers next to a
San Francisco Cable car, which reminds the user of the romantacism associated with a past local that they had spent time with. This is the level of life art and deliberation.
These ideas provide the proper axiom of choice for individual human beings and provide meaning in that meaning is generated by people caring about things.

Historically, I have ignored decoration, because my decorations happen to themselves be the ideas of structure and design. I get sometimes get fullfillment just thinking about abstract structure,
but surprisingly that is evidently not the case with every person and I have been myself learning more about my decorative desires beyond the realms of practical philosophy.
For instance, I have started appreciting paintings and photographs that are aesthetically interesting to me, but cannot necessarily be used symbiotically in combination with other
objects for a particular practical task. Thus, I am getting back to my roots and relearning the art of simple full hearted appreciation, which is so often lost in undergraduate school.

<h2>Individuality and Authorship</h2>
<div class='description'>
I like haveing a presense in my creations. I like the feeling that my work is meaningful, because I was the one to do it. I don't like the feeling of being an interchangable part in
a standardized system. I like doing work where I am forced to use those skills that provide me with identity and make me myself rather than another person. I like attribution,
where I am listed as a worker and I put enough effort in to deserve being attributed. I sometimes wonder if organizations that treat their emplyees like standarized parts and 
take part in pure design by commitee are capable of making art. What the organization gains in efficiency towards a goal of dubious quality, they lose in deliberateness.
Individuals are better at creating specific work for specific purposes and utilizing their entire abilities, whereas organizations are good at coordinating the efforts of individuals
to the detriment of the individual utilization.
</div>

<h2>Curiosity</h2>
<div class='description'>
Curiosity is the desire for information. Intellectual curiosity is the desire to understand. Curiosity plays a role in those people like myself who are drawn towards Philisophical
thinking. It is what drives people from contentment and acceptance of the way our current society and perception of reality works towards questioning and searching for justification
for the beliefs that are held. Intellectual curiosity takes a person on a journey from knowing things out of neccessity to learning about things for sake of thrashing through the ever present
forrest of our own naivete. Intellectual curiosity informs whether you are satisfied with talking to people about what your career happens to have in common with theirs, in
contrast with wanting to converse with people squarely within the realm of ideas of interest within their own life that are not immediatly and obbiously related to your own. Do you 
content yourself with not knowing the details of some facet of life, or do you believe that given an infinite amount of time you will get around to pondering every idea that life has to offer.

<h2>Some Likes and Dislikes</h2>
<div class='description'>
Here is a list of activities and my thoughts on how much I like doing each actitivy in their pure form, namely as a concept or as a reoson for working or existing.
<ul>
<li> Solving Problems: The act of solving problems if growing on me. I now know that problems are sets of conditions that need to be resolved and a solution is an algorithmic (or logically automatic or mechanical)
mapping between any set of input conditions to an appropriate solution using an acceptable amount of resources. Now that I know what problem solving means, I am appreciating 
it more.</li>
<li> Efficiently performing a task: Efficiency by itself brings me almost no joy. I care a lot more about why I do tasks than my ability to do a task. My joy in completing a task
comes primarily from my belief that it is meaningful, rather than a pride in my own fitness for the task. I would rather incompetantly do a meaningful task, than competantly do 
a meaningless task, or worse a task which works against the best interests of the Universe.</li>
<li> Programming: I enjoy programming, in that it is a heart to heart conversation between woman / man and machine and the amount of meaningful work that comes out is in proportion
to the programmers willpower to convert mental ideas into actionable logic.</li>
<li> Emotions: I love emotions. FIXME: add more details.</li>
<li> Fun: I love fun. FIXME: add more details.</li>
</ul>
