<h1>Intellectual Community Building Lab</h1>
<h3>Directed by Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>
The Intellectual Community Building Lab seeks to expand the audience for various academic disciplines by creating compelling works of media and tools for expression. We are currently actively working to serve two main communities: Computer Graphics (a subfield of Computer Science) and Transportation Engineering respectively.

<p class="description">
We seek to make the mathematical theory and pragmatic application of the field of Computer Graphics as accessible as possible, especially for motivated people who find reading the traditional literature to be frustrating. <br>Symbiotically, we seek to develop new algorithms and tools to enable to people to express their Computer Graphics understandings and utilize more of the knowledge from the field, such as the use of Halfedge data structures.

<p class="description">
In collaboration with the NYU Transportation Engineering department, we are creating the Sim Urban computer game about transportation engineering principles. We plan to use the game to better inform the public about the descisions being made in their communities, while also using it to form a new national academic competion, where students can demonstrate their knowledge.

<h2>Join Us</h2>

<p>

If you want to collaborate, please send an email to Bryce Summers at <a href="mailto:bs3363@nyu.edu">bs3363 [at] nyu [dot] edu</a>
Please use the subject "ICBL_Collaboration_Request", since it will help me see the email. Also, please think about what you would like to contribute to the effort, since collaborations only work out when both parties are able to clearly articulate their motivations for the endeavor. Here are some example reasons that I would want to collaborate with you:
<ul>
<li>You are <b>learning</b> Computer Graphics or Transportation Engineering and you would like to critically test and provide feedback on our work. Afterall, if our work doesn't help you learn or provide you with encouraging emotions then we may not be achieving our stated goals.</li>
<li>You are <b>teaching</b> Computer Graphics with similar goals and you want to synchronize our efforts.</li>
<li>You are an <b>artist</b> who loves computation and you want to suggest a related tool that would be useful to you. You can also <a href="https://bryce-summers.github.io/Hire_Bryce_Website/index.html">hire</a> Bryce as a consultant if you have some interesting work related to the ICBL endeavors and he has some room left in his schedule.</li>
<li>You are a <b>Visual Designer</b> who wants to help us present mathematics aesthetically.</li>
<li>You are an <b>urbanist, transportation engineer, politicial, pedestrian, driver, or interested citizen</b>, who wants to help make Sim Urban a better tool for the community.</li>
<li>You are a <b>mathmatician</b> or <b>computer scientist</b> who wants to have passionate conversations with more people.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Thank you for visiting the ICBL!</h3>
