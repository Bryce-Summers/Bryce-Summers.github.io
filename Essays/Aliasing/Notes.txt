These images were generated in Super Collider: http://supercollider.github.io/

They are plots of 2 seconds of audio generated by combining a series of 8 440, 441, 442, etc frequency Sine wave unit generators.

On my computer screen when I resize the window dispplaying the plot, tons of aliasing is present during the rendering of the samples onto the screen and some beautiful shell like patterns emerge.


Code:

s.boot;

(
    var n = 8;
    var beater;
    var beater2;

    beater = {
        Mix.fill(n, { arg index;
            var freq;
            index.postln;
            freq = 440 + index;
            freq.postln;
            SinOsc.ar(freq , 0, 1 / n / 2)
	        })
    };

    beater2 = {
        Mix.fill(n, { arg index;
            var freq;
            index.postln;
		    freq = 440 - 1 - index;
            freq.postln;
            SinOsc.ar(freq , 0, 1 / n / 2)
        })
    };

    {[beater, beater2]}.play;
    beater.plot(2);// Draws the plot of 2 seconds of audio
)

s.quit;
