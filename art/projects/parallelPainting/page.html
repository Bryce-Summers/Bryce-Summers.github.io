<h2>Parallel Painting</h2>

<div class='description'>

I have developed a new method of collaborative painting where a group of people create works of art together in parallel.

</div>

<h3>The method</h3>

<div class='description'>

<ol>
  <li>A theme is chosen, which each person must be working towards.</li>
  <li>Each person is responsible for a single color of paint and is given a blank canvas.</li>
  <li>Each person uses their color of paint and a paint brush to make 3 strokes on the canvas.</li>
  <li>The canvasses are then passed in a circle in a clockwise manner.</li>
  <li>The 3 stroke turns and passings continue until the cooperative agrees that the painting is done.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3> Short Artistic Statement </h3>

<div class='description'>

This project tries to make the abstract concept of parallel computation more concrete through the abstraction of painting. 
This project is inspired by and dedicated to Kayvon, my 15-418 Instructor, who is interested in both Computer Science and painting.
