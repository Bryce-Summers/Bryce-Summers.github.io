<h1>Art Practice</h1>
<p>
My art practice consists of personal projects and larger commercial products that are meaningful to me.
Sometimes they about my observations of the world, sometimes they might be my imagination of things I haven't experienced, or 
</p>

<p>
A listing of our projects will be coming in the future. For now, please see my <a href="old_dinosaurs/index.html">older work.</a>

<tr>
<td>Encoded Geometry</td>
<td>
<a href="">
<img src="./images/bassoon.png"> </a></td> 
<td>I was amazed by kolmogrov complexity and that lines of code could encode all of the information necessary to reproducibly generate an image of objects from our world. I have had lots of experience around musical instruments, so I chose to encode my own versions of a trumpet, an English Horn, and a bassoon. I've know meaningful people who have played each of these instruments. Personally, I play the bassoon.</td>

<tr>
<td>Bryce Font</td>
<td>
<a href="">
<img src="./images/BryceFont2.png"></a></td>
<td>I was annoyed that lots of stuff on my computer was copyrighted and it seemed like any creative work I produced would fall victim to copyright infringement at some level. So, I decided to encode my own fonts to dig one level deeper into feeling a sense of agency in my computational visuals.</td>

<tr>
<td>Java Data Structures</td>
<td>
<a href="">
<img src="./images/"></a></td>
<td>I wrote many data structure during the summer of 2013. I was amazed when I ended up with some of the same design descisions as the professionals that made many of the standards. I saw that there was room for convergent thinking in Computer Science. I also believed that I couldn't take myself seriously if I hadn't actually gone and implemented that data structures that seemed critical for the type of work that I liked to do.</td>

<h2> Algorithms and Data Structures </h2>

<p class="description">
Here is a partial list of algorithms and data structures that I have implemented for fun and joy.

Since most of these have been invented before, these programming projects are art with an audience of myself, where I get to experience the feelings of having implemented them from the logical Turing complete ground of a programing language on up.

<h2> Tabletop Games </h2>

<p>
Especially when I am busy programming non-games, I've found board games to be one of the purest pursuits for practicing the art of pure playtest based iterative design. I have no qualms at all about selling board games for money.
