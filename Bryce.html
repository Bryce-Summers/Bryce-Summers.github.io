<h2>Identity</h2>

I imagine a world where abstract ideas are part of the mainstream culture and where more people have the opportunity to study computer science and other technical disciplines. I imagine animations and stories being about these things.

I work to expand the ways that people are educated. I want to bring in more of a person's senses. How do we better overcome the subjectivity problem in the context of education? I study media's use in education and helping learn about their reality.

I am an educator and media theorist, and an Artist as far as communicating my love for the things I have learned.

<p> First and foremost Bryce describes himself as Bryce, but here are some possible professions that he would partially describe himself by.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Artist</b>, one who wishes to share his observations with the world or his imagination of observations that he hasn't had. A good artist carfully prioritizes which observations are most deserving of being shared. An artist makes their observations take form in the world, such that they go beyond the memory, mind, and/or presence of their creator.
<li><b>Computer Scientist</b>, one who critically evaluates and invents the tools they use and the way problems are solved.</li>
<li><b>Game Designer</b>, one who creates desirable ways of acting, through the creation of a rules.</li>
<li><b>Mathmatician</b>, one who wishes to formally structure the facets of reality and patterns that they observe in the universe.</li>
<li><b>Educator</b>, one who creates experiences where people are motivated to learn and continue learning afterwards without apathy.</li>
<li><b>Storyteller,</b> one who invents and sequences communicating events in harmony with an audience's interests.</li>
<li><b>Researcher,</b> one who builds new knowledge on top of previous knowledge.</li>
<li><b>Semiotician,</b> one who studies the transfer of meaning through communication, including non-linguistic visual sign systems. I find the study of meaning to be very meaningful.</li>
<li><b>Semanticist,</b> one who ponders the meaning denoted by specific signs, like words. Puns and other wordplay derived from the overloaded meanings of words interest me.</li>
<li><b>Aesthetician,</b> one who studies subjectivity and its relationship to motivation, interests, beauty, and levels of details.</li>
<li><b>Musician</b> one who expresses themself through sound.</li>
<li><b>Learning Theorist,</b> one who develops theories for how human learning occurs and how we can create better experiences for learning to occur.</li>
<li><b>Entrepreneur,</b> one who finds funding and sustainable models of economic motivation for work towards meaningful goals.</li>
<li><b>Project Manager,</b> one who assembles teams of people and works out the plan for helping them collaborate and keeping their stress levels in control to achieve meaningful goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>More Specific</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>New Media Artist,</b> one who shares his observations of new mediums of expression and the freedom of people to voice their observations through these mediums.</li>
<li><b>Computer Graphics Educator,</b> one who helps people learn the technical knowledge of this sub-field of Computer Science and who encourages them to use this knowledge for the betternment of humanity.</li>
<li><b>Computational Visual Storyteller,</b> one who uses computation to visually and narratively tell stories about the historical journey of Computer Science Research and the knowledge that people might want to know.</li>
<li><b>Computational Semiotics Researcher,</b> one who develops new algorithms for generating images and visual languages that meaningfully communicate information to people.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Craft</h3>

I prefer work that is meant to affect other people's minds, rather than work that provides some sort of physical service. I would rather inform people about methods of making pipes, than sell them actual pipes to bring them water.

I prefer to work on projects where I am able to use my work in future projects. When working for others, I prefer to work as a service, where they pay me for my time, but I can still use the code, images, etc. that I produce in my future work.

<ul>
<li><b>Thinker.</b> I use my mind to create and refine ideas and idiology.</li>
<li><b>Programmer.</b> To accomplish my work I talk to machines.</li>
<li><b>Animator.</b> I animate motion and transformation via computer programming.</li>
<li><b>Writer.</b> I put meaningful sequences of letters together.</li>
<li><b>Bassoonist.</b> I perform music by playing my bassoon.</li>
<li><b>Singer.</b> I am liable to start singing at any given time.</li>
</ul>

I make projects that try to communicate something to its users. That is what makes me happy and feel fulfilled.

I am curious about how computers can communicate with us. Human conversation when towards an end amounts to a binary search on meanings. We ask questions in order to synthesize our interpretations of a particular work or concept. In the conversation, every question and phrase is curated based on what the learned knows and wants to know. The two people can apply indirect phrasings when they have shared understanding and this short hand yields pleasure, because both people feel close.

The communication of ideas is my greatest curiosity. I want to use computers to enhance human communication.

My interest in gaming is that it mutates the social dynamics present in reality and allows people to express themselves more to me than they otherwise would. Computer games provided experiences that I couldn't get in the real world like building a city. As I learned how to program, my need for computer games diminished somewhat, but now I want to build them to scalfold others.

I like doing things by trying and failing. I can't usually do things the first time without experience, so I need the experience of trying and failing first before I can eventually learn.

I used to not like doing things with uncertain outcomes, such as applying for schools or jobs, because I didn't want to waste my time on something that doesn't produce a desirable outcome in accordance to perfect time managed life theory. What I now believe is that I should focus on the experience and things learned along the way. The things I learn by applying to a school, job, award, relationship, etc matter more sometimes than whether I got what I wanted, because they inform my knowledge of who I am and how I might act in the future.

I don't limit myself to the science of objective reality. I believe strongly in the science of the self, where I seek to test out which behaviors of mine reproduce the same emotional outcomes. Objective reality is important at times for converging my work into specific final outcomes.

<h3> Internal </h3>

I have two main internal personality traits / drivers:
<ul>
<li>The quest for computational love through understanding which rules ought to be used and followed and how to create new elegant rules. This leads me to like people willing to play board games with me or talk about culture.</li>
<li>Valuing understanding. I find it hard for me to act before I have worked out an internal logic for understanding the situation that I am making descisions in. This leads me to like people who want to engage in intellectual discussions. </li>
<li>Strong slower moving emotions that inform my intuition, which I follow. This leads me to like people who are willing to talk about their emotions with me, so that I can more explicitly work through my theories of people and grow to know them.</li>
</ul>

If some of the most motivated people going to the best educational program for their field can't learn what they are searching for without undue emotional cost, then something is wrong or this is a problem to be solved. It is also a problem when people can't separate the joy and importance of a discipline from the money that flows through it. Many of the most intelligent hard working people are paid less when they try to do more. I believe that Computer Science may be used to solve problems of the self.

I also want to use computer science to improve the tools for others to communicate the things they want to tell me.


<h3>Why do I make art about computer science?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because the people making descisions about people's lives don't know what the field is about.</li>
<li>Because parents pay lots of money to improve their child's future, but then they force them to take non-computer science courses.</li>
<li>Because the world doesn't get that computer science brings a computer scientist joy as much as music does to a muscician or looking up at the stars does to an Astronomer.</li>
<li>Because people on this quest get stressed out, become isolated from human caring, and suffer from mental healh problems.</li>
<li>Because computer science culture is not present in the early years of many people's lives.</li>
<li>Because the world needs better toolmakers.</li>
<li>Because there are strong emotional stories from this field that are not being told, because many Computer Scientists are not making public facing art because it is difficult for them to articulate their inner motivations and feelings with the people around them.</li>
<li>Because lonely computer scientists out there need to know that others like them are out there and care about them.</li>
<li>Because Computer Science is not an engineering discipline, and cs students need to overcome their loved one's lack of awareness. </li>
<li>Because the mental journey is just as real as the physical journey.</li>
<li>Because a true love for Computer Science should not be written off as simply a matter of upbringing and privledge. They may help, but there ain't no shortcut to a place worth going.</li>
<li>Because Computer Scientists care about people just as much as psychologists and humanists.</li>
<li>Because Computer Science transcends gender, race, social class, politeness, etc.</li>
<li>Because the beautiful abstract processes at work in our world deserve to be seen by more people.</li>
<li>Because Computer Scientists should be mentored on making new tools, rather than instructed to make existing tools.</li>
<li>Because a Computer Scientist should meet a commuunity of Computer Scientists when they move across the land to an educational institution offering a Computer Science curriculum.
</ul>

<h3> Why isn't there more art about Computer Scientists? </h3>

<p>
I think it is because most Computer Scientists who have the life experience which they could share are by their nature more interested in creating the pipes that deliver content and data, rather than making the content itself. Also, it can be hard to pin down something as specific and emotional as one's own feelings. It is taking me at least two years of dedicated study to adapt my mathematical mindset to a human experience one.
</p>


What does it mean to investigate the science of the self.

Why do I spend time articulating my reasons, when I could just say it makes me happy? In my past, people I care about have attacked my interests questioning why I won't go save the world for them by becoming a software engineer or why I'm fixated on education, when games and stories are meant for entertainment. While some people may accept that a bassoon player simply likes the sound of their instrument, that an astronomer is interested in the stars, it is difficult for people to accept that I pursue Computer Science as a means of finding joy and helping others find joy. An Artist can emerge from any field or interest. There is nothing about Computer Scientific knowledge that provides a moral imperative that prevent a person from applying that knowledge to the creation of art. For that matter, art is no less useful that Computer Science. The world needs people solving the problems of physicality with Computer Science, but it also needs people like me who are solving the problems of emotion, dreams, and inspiration, necessary for people to pursue this field. So, the reason I articulate my reasons is so that I am able to confidantly respond and defend myself against the narrow minded views that may try to convince me that my interests are not worthwhile or prudent.

Blog Posts I should write:
Science of the self, theory of marginal logical leaps / learning flow, emotion theory, mathematics vs. human exerience. People don't stand perfectly in lines, bus people / train people.

I like diners, Cheeseburgers, silverware, subway stations, trains, infrastructure, musical instruments, Computers. I'm interested in Sand Castles, Mining, the weather.

<h3> External </h3>

I have several notable external traits that inform the way I interact and am experienced by other people.
<ul>
<li> Shyness. I am a rather shy when interacting with new people, because it takes time for me to come up with a mental model of who they are and I don't know if they would want to play board games or not.</li>
<li> Tourettes Syndrome. Once I am interacting with someone, they sometimes rely on body language, which in my case may give them quite a lot of misinformation. I have many different levels of involuntary body movement that have no more meaning than non-verbal noise, but may be interpreted as me giving directions, or not being glad to see someone, which is not the case.</li>
<li> Slow Processing speed. Once I am talking with someone, my mind processes new or unexpected information slow enough that new aquaintances are surprised by the delay when conversing with me. I don't know if it is because I am thinking slower than average or whether I am thinking more than average.</li>
<li> Stuttering. Once I know what to say, I don't have full control over articulating it, especially when I am nervous. Sometimes I substitute words when the original doesn't feel like it wants to come out. The upside is substitution build one's vocabulary and leads to the formation of linguistic objects like puns that thrive on the ability to communicate the same meaning in multiple ways or multiple meaings at once.</li>
<li> Interests. Once the message does get to the person, I'm not sure they are always as interested in talking about transportation network topology or data structures. I have a habit of staying in the Bryce mind, perhaps more than is healthy. It is hard for me to imagine what is going on in other people's heads, but I think my imagination and interpretation abbility is getting better over time as I have more experiences that allow me to latch onto what people are sharing with me.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Some resonant quotes I made up </h3>

<ul>
<li> Computer Science doen't need computer, nor even mathematics. </li>
<li> I am on a quest for computational love. </li>
<li> We are all illiterate in many ways. I combat computer science illiteracy.</li>
<li> Psychology is the gap between out minds.</li>
<li> Economics is the gap between desires and availible resources. </li>
<li> Art is the dedication to interests uncommonly shared. </li>
<li> Idiology is the point at which people stop saying you don't know how to do something and start saying that you shouldn't do something.
</ul>

<h3> Why do I do what I do? </h3>

<p>
I make art about understanding Computer Science. I make it because there are young people out there who could dream about Computer Science. I want invite them on the journey, even when the people around them might only know to call them an engineer, provide emotional support on the way there, even when the members of this field are not always as emotionally open, and help people build up the confidance in themselves to pursue their dreams relentlessly, even when the road is rocky and prospects for financial and community support seem dim.
</p>

<p>
Also, as our society becomes more complex, and people need to do more complicated work, I want to help more people to overcome the emotional hurdles in learning these beautiful ideas, which may be able to support them through their lives.
</p>

<p>
The other half of my work is doing Computer Science to improve the processes by which people make art and communication objects, like teaching materials. Many people have a gift for a certain way of thinking and people will come along in this world who will know a better ways of doing things. I want them to be able to share their perspective with the world so that I and the others will be able to learn from them.

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

I am a computer science educator, because I want to transfer the emotions and motivations between generations of people.


I am a procedural historian, I want to discuss the evolution in computational and procedural thinking over the years through archiving the history of computer graphics algorithms and telling narratives about them such as in my algorithm designer animated television show.


Computer Scientists critically question the tools they use.
Mathmaticians seek to formally structure the world and universe that they obeserve.
Artists 



I want to make technology and the digital world open to culture and tinkering. Power to the people.

Teaching Philosophy,

I teach computer science and any mathematics that may be of use to computer science.
Linear Algebra, Transportation Network Engineering, Computational Biology and Morphology.

I believe that we solve problems for kindness and for fun. Wanting to communicate known things to people is just as justifiable as trying to solve new problems.


Present my idiology, show students that my idiology may be used for them to bounce their idiology off of.

The students get an 'A' if they satisfy my goal or their goal in the course.

I care more about the process than the final result. The final result serves as a goal and guide for the process. Computer Science Education should focus more on helping students hone their creative processes.


I am the nemesis of apathy.
I am a semiotician, I study the creation of meaning. I am also a semantician and aesthetician.

People want to be enfranchised in the digital age, but when they find themselves barred from the knowledge through emotionally insensitive teaching practices they get their hearts broken.


A secondary goal of mine is to create detailed maps of the networks of cities. This will require detailed data, which is historically only in archives, engineering drawings, and plans for ancient times. Collecting this data would be necessary for my desires.

All projects are the work of Bryce, collaborators, and team members.

<h2> Vision </h2>
<p>

I want communication to be filled with more love, effort, and empathy for the other. Only then will our audience continue to dream and will our message find alignment with their emotions. I want people to dream about mathematical, scientific, technical, and theoretical ideas if they so choose and have the power to devote their existance to these topics. I want people to have the power and confidance to put their names on their work. I want to combat apathy towards these types of thinking, especially the invisible infrastructure and abstract ideas coloring the way we live.

</p>

<h2> Mission </h2>
<p>
I improve the tools for communication between human beings. Not the infrastructure that carries the message, but the messages themselves. I am particularly interested in non peer to peer communication, such as with experts and students. I am also interested in the deeply subjective, tools for individuals with amazing ideas, rather than tools for objective users abstracted to a few common behaviors.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis is on visual media, which includes imagery, computer games, graphic novels, animations, animated television series, computational tools, interfaces, mazes, sand castles, coloring books, line drawings, motion graphics, etc. A few projects have also involved tactile media, such as the "Hump Yard" board game about data structures an algorithms that uses custom made toy manipulatives to provide a Computer Science experience that doesn't involve a computer. Some projects also involve auditory media, such as a musical that is currently in the works that seeks to expand popular conceptions of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
I tend to make these works in small teams. 'Small' allows for better creative direction and because I want sophisticated media productions to be made with smaller budgets so that educators can use media to help their students without being prohibited by cost and so that people can more easily express the amazing ideas floating in their heads, including those I may not understand. 'Team' ensures that I have people to bounce my ideas off of and every creative project improves when their are more motivated perspectives working on it.
