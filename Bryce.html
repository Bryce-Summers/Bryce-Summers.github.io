<h2>Identity</h2>

<p> First and foremost Bryce describes himself as Bryce, but here are some possible professions that he would partially describe himself by.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Artist</b>, one who wishes to share his observations with the world. A good artist carfully prioritizes which observations are most deserving of being shared. An artist makes their observations take form in the world, such that they go beyond the memory, mind, and/or presence of their creator.
<li><b>Mathmatician</b>, one who wishes to formally structure the facets of reality and patterns that they observe in the universe.</li>
<li><b>Computer Scientist</b>, one who critically evaluates and invents the tools they use and the way problems are solved.</li>
<li><b>Game Designer</b>, one who creates desirable ways of acting, through the creation of a rules.</li>
<li><b>Educator</b>, one who creates experiences where people are motivated to learn and continue learning afterwards without apathy.</li>
<li><b>Storyteller,</b> one who invents and sequences communicating events in harmony with an audience's interests.</li>
<li><b>Researcher,</b> one who builds new knowledge on top of previous knowledge.</li>
<li><b>Semiotician,</b> one who studies the transfer of meaning through communication, including non-linguistic visual sign systems. I find the study of meaning to be very meaningful.</li>
<li><b>Semanticist,</b> one who ponders the meaning denoted by specific signs, like words. Puns and other wordplay derived from the overloaded meanings of words interest me.</li>
<li><b>Aesthetician,</b> one who studies subjectivity and its relationship to motivation, interests, beauty, and levels of details.</li>
<li><b>Musician</b> on who expresses themself through sound.</li>
<li><b>Learning Theorist,</b> one who develops theories for how human learning occurs and how we can create better experiences for learning to occur.</li>
<li><b>Entrepreneur,</b> one who finds funding and sustainable models of economic motivation for work towards meaningful goals.</li>
<li><b>Project Manager,</b> one who assembles teams of people and works out the plan for helping them collaborate and keeping their stress levels in control to achieve meaningful goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>More Specific</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>New Media Artist,</b> one who shares his observations of new mediums of expression and the freedom of people to voice their observations through these mediums.</li>
<li><b>Computer Graphics Educator,</b> one who helps people learn the technical knowledge of this sub-field of Computer Science and who encourages them to use this knowledge for the betternment of humanity.</li>
<li><b>Computational Visual Storyteller,</b> one who uses computation to visually and narratively tell stories about the historical journey of Computer Science Research and the knowledge that people might want to know.</li>
<li><b>Computational Semiotics Researcher,</b> one who develops new algorithms for generating images and visual languages that meaningfully communicate information to people.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Craft</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Thinker.</b> I use my mind to create and refine ideas and idiology.</li>
<li><b>Programmer.</b> To accomplish my work I talk to machines.</li>
<li><b>Animator.</b> I animate motion and transformation via computer programming.</li>
<li><b>Writer.</b> I put meaningful sequences of letters together.</li>
<li><b>Bassoonist.</b> I perform music by playing my bassoon.</li>
<li><b>Singer.</b> I am liable to start singing at any given time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

I am a computer science educator, because I want to transfer the emotions and motivations between generations of people.


I am a procedural historian, I want to discuss the evolution in computational and procedural thinking over the years through archiving the history of computer graphics algorithms and telling narratives about them such as in my algorithm designer animated television show.


Computer Scientists critically question the tools they use.
Mathmaticians seek to formally structure the world and universe that they obeserve.
Artists 



I want to make technology and the digital world open to culture and tinkering. Power to the people.

Teaching Philosophy,

I teach computer science and any mathematics that may be of use to computer science.
Linear Algebra, Transportation Network Engineering, Computational Biology and Morphology.

I believe that we solve problems for kindness and for fun. Wanting to communicate known things to people is just as justifiable as trying to solve new problems.


Present my idiology, show students that my idiology may be used for them to bounce their idiology off of.

The students get an 'A' if they satisfy my goal or their goal in the course.

I care more about the process than the final result. The final result serves as a goal and guide for the process. Computer Science Education should focus more on helping students hone their creative processes.


I am the nemesis of apathy.
I am a semiotician, I study the creation of meaning. I am also a semantician and aesthetician.

People want to be enfranchised in the digital age, but when they find themselves barred from the knowledge through emotionally insensitive teaching practices they get their hearts broken.


A secondary goal of mine is to create detailed maps of the networks of cities. This will require detailed data, which is historically only in archives, engineering drawings, and plans for ancient times. Collecting this data would be necessary for my desires.

All projects are the work of Bryce, collaborators, and team members.

<h2> Vision </h2>
<p>
My mission is to broaded the community of people who are excited about mathematical, scientific, technical, and theoretical ideas and empower them to apply the implications of the ideas in their lives and work. I want more people to put their names on their work. I also want to combat apathy towards these types of thinking.
</p>

<h2> Mission </h2>
<p>
I create media products and production processes used to tell stories about the technical details of ideas.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis is on visual media, which includes imagery, computer games, graphic novels, animations, animated television series, computational tools, interfaces, mazes, sand castles, coloring books, line drawings, motion graphics, etc. A few projects have also involved tactile media, such as the "Hump Yard" board game about data structures an algorithms that uses custom made toy manipulatives to provide a Computer Science experience that doesn't involve a computer. Some projects also involve auditory media, such as a musical that is currently in the works that seeks to expand popular conceptions of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
I tend to make these works in small teams. 'Small' allows for better creative direction and because I want sophisticated media productions to be made with smaller budgets so that educators can use media to help their students without being prohibited by cost and so that people can more easily express the amazing ideas floating in their heads, including those I may not understand. 'Team' ensures that I have people to bounce my ideas off of and every creative project improves when their are more motivated perspectives working on it.
