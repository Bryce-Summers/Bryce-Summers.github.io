<h2>Ticket Roll Line Renderings</h2>

<div class='description'>

During the Spring of 2016 I was running the Carnegie Mellon movie theatre on weekends,
where we sold tickets from tightly packed rolls. I was also hanging out at the STUDIO for 
creative Inquiry where saw the amazing
<a href="http://ben-snell.com/">Ben Snell</a> make some 
<a href="http://ben-snell.com/Robot-Drawings">drawings</a>
with a robot arm that reminded me of the patterns that I was observing in the ticket rolls. So,
I decided to go and make some simple 2D computer generated line drawings representing my own
take on the phenomena. I dedicate them to my friend Ben. Please take note of the aliasing patterns 
and the distictions between line size, line curvature, etc.

document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML +
"<img src=\"o" + i + ".png\" alt=\"ticket roll rendering image\"  width=\"50%\">";
