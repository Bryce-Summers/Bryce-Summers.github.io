The SummersCAMP program is an ambitious interactive tool that seeks to provide a visual based means of abstracting the process of doing linear algebra computations, 
especially in introductory linear algebra courses. The goal of the project is to make mathematical computation user friendly and accessible to normal users.
<br>

To achieve this goal, the development and promotion of this program are ongoing. Although the design of the program is not yet perfect,
it is likely much more user friendly than standard Computer algebra systems such as Mathematica, 
which are primarily text based and require knowledge of programming and/or syntax.
