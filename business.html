<h1>Business</h1>
<p>
While we like writing open source software and sharing our algorithms with the world, we commercialize our products when practically or financially sensible. For instance, we commercialize our physical products such as board games, graphic novels, and coloring books that have real manufacturing, distribution, and storage costs.
We also commercialize projects that would take a prohibitive amount of time or cost to complete, such as competition quality computer games when we don't have a benefactor.
</p>

<p>
A listing of our projects will be coming in the future. For now, please see my <a href="old_dinosaurs/index.html">older work.</a>

<h3>Thank you for your interest in our work.</h3>
