<h1>Thesis</h1>
<h3>by Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>
I am building theories, methedologies for applying these theories, and tools exemplifying these methedologies.
</p>

I disagree that research should be shared in writing. I think that writing is good for peer to peer communication, but not as good for communicating to people without a corpus of understanding in the topic. I also think that people need to apply the knowledge before they can really understand it.

<td>Communication to non-experts lacking foundational vocabulary will be more efficient through Art than through synthesis. For example, children will benefit from an awareness of fields that may interest them, and the public at large who do not know what the field of Computer Science cares about.
