<tr>
<td>Keenan Crane</td>
<td></td>
<td>He is making the invisible world of discrete differential geometry visible and meaningful. He has also done a fantastic job of synthesizing information in his teaching.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Katherine Ye</td>
<td></td>
<td>She is making the ingrediants for mathematical arguments visible and meaningful.</td>

<td>Kayvon Fatahalian</td>

<td>He is making the differences between processors and visible and meaningful.</td>

<!-- Synthesizers and storytellers-->

<tr>
<td>Robert Tarjan</td>
<td></td>
<td>Tarjan has a gift for articulating himself clearly and conscisely in writing. His delivery of meaning to peers is as efficient as his beautiful algorithms. I especially like his book, Data Structure and Network Algorithms.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>His Patreon channel 3 Blue, 1 Brown, produces animations about mathematics the exhibit craft in their production and stories that have been well user tested.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Steins;Gate</td>
<td></td>
<td>Steins;Gate is my favorite story that I have ever seen. As far as humanizing abstract concepts, Steins;Gate gets to the heart and complexity of time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LogixComix</td>
<td></td>
<td>It nails the heart of why early 20th century mathmaticians cared about solidifying the foundations of mathematics.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Trashed</td>
<td></td>
<td>A humerous tail that both visualizes the waste system and synthesizes lots of information about it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Stuff Matters</td>
<td></td>
<td>I came away caring a lot more about the hardness of materials, whether they melt in one's mouth, etc. Awareness and synthesis of material science. This book also clearly explained on the chemical level why glass lets visible light through, but not ultraviolet radiation. We are using the structure of this book as a guide for our Graphic Novel story environment.</td>

<!-- Game Designers -->

<tr>
<td>Space Chem</td>
<td></td>
<td>Players create chemical reactions through a simplified procedural model of atomic bonding.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>The Resistance</td>
<td></td>
<td>Players practice the art of concealing and deducing information about the motivations of their fellow players.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rollercoaster Tycoon</td>
<td></td>
<td>Players build rollercoasters while being constrained by the laws of physics, and of human experience.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Arun</td>
<td></td>
<td>His screaming booth at CMU was an interactive experience that encouraged people to make their feelings of stress known loudly and publically to the community. It was brilliant.</td>
