<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h3>by Bryce Summers</h3>

<h2> Interview Response </h2>

<p>
I am responding to the intriging interview of Ariana Ijaduola in the INTER magazine. I have met and talked with Ari over the past year and she has tried to convince me that we have diferences in behavior because she sees herself as a 'visual' person. She clearly finds prefers youtube videos, whereas I prefer static images when we go to receive technical information. I was unconvinced however, because I see myself as a visual person as well. I went about theorizing that perhaps we see the same images in our miind, but we process them in different manners due to disparate interests. I also think that their are other factors such as mental processing speed at play, because although I am quick at using pre-cached information, I am confidant that my mind processes new incoming information slower than that of an average brain, which is why I have received double time on nearly every test that I have taken in my life. I theorize that Ari focuses on the concrete details of what she is seeing, and that I tend to see the more abstract details such as skin materiality, facial morphology. I wonder if this is what has led me to like mathematics, or whether my interest in the abstract has simply informed my way of seeing. In any event, I would ask Ari if there are any insights from her research that could be used in my attempts to elevate the awareness of mathematics through similar inquiries into Illustration.

<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>
I did the reading.
</p>

<h2>3 Visuals</h2>

<p>
My visuals are meant to illustrate the three stages of empathetic teaching between non-peers.
</p>

<p>
The first one is about abstraction. It shows an example depiction of a sphere a normal, and a uniform aura, meant to depict diffuse light reflection. I think that images such as these should be used more when communicating novel technical information.
</p>
<img src="./week2_images/abstraction.png" style="width: 425px;">
<p>
The second image is an amalgamation of different stylings for a narrator character who will be walking my readers through a book I'm writing on Computer Graphics.
</p>

<img src="./week2_images/story.jpg" style="width: 425px;">
<p>
The third image is of the Space Chem game, that satisfies most of my criteria for an Educational Game: It presents the material through mechanics, rather than skin, it allows the player to act at the level of meaning, it scalfolds the experience of working with chemical bonding, it provides space for creativity, where players can come up with better solutions over time.
