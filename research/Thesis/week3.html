<h2> Writing and Idea Development Process </h2>

<p>
Here are some questions that I wrote down to myself of a sheet of paper.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do I want to make tools for communication?</li>
<li>Who would benefit from my approach?</li>
<li>Why not just go and make good art?</li>
<li>Why do people surrender to the ideas of others?</li>
<li>Who cares about caring more than needing?</li>
<li>Where would my ideas find ressonance?</li>
<li>Where are the people willing to take intellectual risks?</li>
<li>Where are the people doing similar work?</li>
<li>When will people care more about the problems than the answers?</li>
<li>How can I present the truth about Computer Science?</li>
<li>Why is understanding and production separated?</li>
<li>Why are Computer Scientists less interested in culture or expressing their souls through art, rather than implicitly through their work?</li>
<li>How do we bridge the divide between objective expression and subjective expression?</li>
<li>Where is the divide between mathematics and human experience?</li>
<li>Why do people go to Computer Science Schools to become software Engineers?</li>
<li>Where are the caring communities of Computer Scientists?</li>
<li>Where is the line between effort based compensation and caring based compensation??</li>
<li>How do I encourage more people to go beyond survival and onwards to bringing their unique ideas to the world?</li>
<li>Why do we still educate people to know answers, rather than themselves?</li>
<li>Why do people care more about degrees than skills and ideas?</li>
<li>How can I improve things without overly criticizing the results of 100's of years of educational thought?</li>
<li>Why do we find it so hard to know each other?</li>
<li>Why is creativity so hard, whereas conformity is so empty?</li>
<li>Should a buisness really be made about communication?</li>
<li>What should a social support system look like for communicators?</li>
</ul>

<h2> Historical Timeline </h2>

<p>
Here are some ideas for events. I thought about events and theories regarding educational communication, art about computer science, and notions of large school social norms, and investigated possible ideas for events. I then looked for a rough year date of the initiation of the theory or event.

<td>Jiahu Symbols</td>

<td>984</td>
<td>Snell's Law</td>
<td>Ibn Sahl derived Snell's law in the manuscript On Burning Mirrors and Lenses. This law finds a mathematical explanation for why the image of a pencil in water is bent, when the object in reality is straight. While refraction is commonly used to indicate the flaws in visual perception and to justify the elevated position of writing, discoveries like Snell's law show that it is not the vision that is deceptive, rather our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature that are used to create the image.</td>

<td>Factory Model School</td>
<td>Inspired by Prussia, Horace Mann brought over what is now the defacto standard model for public education, characterized by impersonal secular building, efficiency, and an emphasis on training students to be obedient productive citizens. The schools were free however and led to widespread educational opportunities in America.</td>

<tr>
<td>Social Norms</td>
<td>19th Century</td>
<td>Social norms dictate informal rules in society that are followed without communication. Sociology theorists such as Karl Marx, Talcott Parsons, Heinrich Popitz< have created theories for the development of social roles. For instance, Popitz believes that social norms can avoid mental processing by the brain and thereby speed up social interaction. I personally am skeptical of social norms and actively try to remove those that seem arbitrary. I would like every social norm to have an explicit reason./td>

<tr>
<td>1924</td>
<td>Zone of proximal Development</td>
<td>Lev Vygotsky defined the zone of proximal development as the difference between what a learner can do unaided and what they cannot do. The theory states that the role of education is to provide learners with experiences that they can do with guidance.</td>

<tr>
<td>1946â€“1964</td>
<td>U.S. Baby Boom</td>
<td>The U.S. had a period of high births following World War II. Birth spikes like these tax the U.S. social services, such as the education system which lead them to prefer standardization and quantity over quality. This creates a scarcity in high quality educational experiences which drives up tuition costs, which in turn increases the dependance of educated students on the standardized labor market. It also increased the number of young and old people who are dependant on the working age people to keep society moving.</td>

<tr>
<td>1950</td>
<td>Scallfolding Theory</td>
<td>Jerome Bruner developed this theory when thinking about language acquisition in young children.
The ideas is that an expert provides a lots of cognitive support and details at the beginning, but as a learner progresses, the supports are taken away until the learner becomes independant. This is intended to keep a child's learning in the zone of proximal development.</td>
