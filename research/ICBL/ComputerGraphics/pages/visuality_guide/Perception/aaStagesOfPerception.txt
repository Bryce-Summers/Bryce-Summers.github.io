Signal
 - Photorealism as the machine captures physical photons.

Eyes Frequency response.
 - The human perceives only that light that is visible to them.
 - They perceive it in a red, blue, and green spectrum
 - Color blind people perceive limited spectrums.
 - Snakes perceive infrared.

Noise Removal
 - The Signal is parsed into an iconic form.

Discretization
 - The signal is chopped up into constituent objects.

    Extant
     - The extant of the object on the view plane.

     Chop by Contrast
     - Contrast is used to discretize and divide extants.

Contextual Comparison
 - We infer the unknown properties from the know properties.

    Quantization
     - We assign meanings to known objects. The meanings may also then be assigned normative names.

    Inference
     - we use the known meanings to infer the unknown meanings.
     - we can infer scale using familiar objects such as humans.
     - We can infer depth based on our familiarity with light scattering, such as with a foggy city.

Various regions inffluence each other due to signal fatigue. This can lead to optical illusions.

Connections
 - We perceive groups according to Gestalt Psychology.
