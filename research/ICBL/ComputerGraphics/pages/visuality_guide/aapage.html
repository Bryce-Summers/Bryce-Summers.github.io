<h1>Visuality Guide</h1>
<h3>by Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>

This page shows and describes guidelines for visuality in the Graphics Diner Project.

There are 6 sections:

<ol>
<li>perception</li>
<li>geometry</li>
<li>materiality</li>
<li>light transport</li>
<li>topology</li>
<li>computer systems</li>
</ol>

</p>

<h2>Perception</h2>

<p>
Here are some references:
<ul>
<li>Edward Tufte Books.</li>
<li>Interaction of Color by Josef Albers.</li>
<li>Gestalt Psychology</li>
<li>Visual Design</li>

While the photons may have any frequency, they are projected into how far their wavelenth's line up with the receptors of the animal perceiving them.

The Silhouettes determine the visual extent of an object. Projections from other vantage points can indicate more of the 3D form of the object. Shadows are nothing more than projections.

Geometry
- Shape, form, structure, without lighting.
- Shadow can provide more details about the overall structure.

<h2>Materiality</h2>
<p>
When showing materiality, it is important to show properties at the photon level and at the beam/image level. The microbehavior produces the macro behavior, but depending on the context, a computer scientist will need to think about both properties.

Materiality deals with the overall behavior of how a surface interacts with all possible spectrums of incoming light.

<td>
<ul>
<li>Diffuse reflectance is characterized by uniform hemi-spheres of light reflecting from an object. </li>
<li>On the individual path scale, the bouncing is uniformly random.
On the beam scale the bean bounces as a hemi-sphere away from the point of impact.</li>
<li> Yellow aura's can indicate that a surface material is emmitting photons. Suns emit, mirrors scatter.

</td>
<td>Lambertian Reflectance is the combination of diffuse reflection and the law of cosines. Light comes in with a directionality and is scattered uniformly randomly at every point, therebye every point is seen by the eye in proportion to the number of photons coming in. Because of the law of cosines, the proportion of photons hitting a surface point to the total energy of the beam of light is equivalent to the cosince of angle between the surface normal and the incoming beam of light.

I find that understanding this is very tricky for people. <br> <br>

Please see the law of cosines diagrams in the light sections.

Materiality

<h2>Light</h2>

<p>
How to show light, without shape?
Show properties of light + shape without materiality?

Light encompasses the way photons act, directionality, frequency. What can happen to them when they hit a surface, etc.
