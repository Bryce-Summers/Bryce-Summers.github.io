Any communication should convey the feelings, meanings, and social norms of a concept.

It is important that representational imagery, meaningful structure and layout, and finnally the words be combined together.

The subjective part is subjective, but it should be present when communicating to people who have not yet being socially conditioned.


I am trying to debunk social norms that are mitigating the transfer of information between people.

In other words, I am developing theories for decreasing the cognitive burden we put on the next generations.
