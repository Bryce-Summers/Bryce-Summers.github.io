<h1>Theories</h1>
<h3>by Bryce Summers</h3>

<p>
Here is an index of theories that I am developing, mostly regarding learning and communication.
Please click on the links to see details. Each page details the previous work that I am aware of which created our current understanding of the theory and then my work that contributes to our understanding of the theory. 
</p>

<p>
If you see something that you have critical thoughts about, then please feel free to contact me and strengthen the theory by debunking it or providing new information that hasn't yet been addressed.
