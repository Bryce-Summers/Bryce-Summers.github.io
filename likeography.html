<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class='description'>

This page lists examples of ideas, products, people, that I like and why I like them. When listing people, 
I have only included some of those whose work appeals to me, rather than those whose personalities or relationship with me is appealing.
I have also ommited things that I don't like about the entities discussed, such as those board games on this list with annoying setup behavior. I only claim that these entities contain things about them that I really like that have stuck with me.

<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Why I like the game.</th>
</tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Settlers of Catan</a></td><td>This was my introduction to Euro games in my Middle School After School Board Game club.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Bohnanza</a></td><td> The pinical of trading games. I have learned about social intelligence by playing this game with people who are very good at making deals.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">The Resistance</a></td><td>This game brings out inner conflicts between logic and emotion in players. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Spite and Malice</a></td><td>I used to play this traditional playing card game with my Grandmother and it includes a 'take that' mechanic where I can go past my opponant's goal card. It also includes fun resource management where I can build up piles cards to play. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Chess</a></td><td> I liked that chess was loved by enough players that it developed a community of people studying strategies for playing.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Go</a></td><td>I like the elegance of the simple rules and that advanced players play in an entirely different style than beginner players. There are things that we are not seeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Tokaido</a></td><td> I like how calm and serene this game is. You get points for having the best time. I've played this game during those times when my life is full of stress. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Fluxx</a></td><td> Along with Bang! this is one of the most memorable designer games I bought growing up. I love that we can steer the game towards actions that we enjoy doing and that the randomness leads to lots of surprises and fun. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Bang!</a></td><td> Their are few things I enjoy doing more than knocking someone out of a game of Bang! with a stream of bullets. As far as fighting goes, Bang! and "You missed!" are the pinnacle for me. Being knocked out isn't as fun, but it makes knocking others out more meaningful. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Ticket to Ride</a></td><td> I like that this game streamlines graph theory. I've never been able to think of a graph theory experience as compelling as Alan Moon's design. It appeals to lots of people, so I can find players for it more often than some other games.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Anti-Monopoly</a></td><td></td>This is an intellectual version of Monopoly, like the original was supposed to be. I can't say that is is a very fun game, but the higher order concept appeals to the educational game designer in me.</tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Magic: The Gathering</a></td><td> I like spending hours building a deck. I also liked the themes, such as rats, zombies, elves, etc. Player interactivity was a highlight for me once I started making more responsive decks. I don't play this game anymore, because I don't want to get back in the habit of spending money on new cards.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Pokemon Trading Card Game</a></td><td>I liked the strategy and that I learned to read by playing this card game as a child, because I needed to read the rules in order to win more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Yugioh Trading Card Game</a></td><td> I liked the layout of the different card types and zones, along with the limits in the game. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="">Food Chain Magnate</a></td><td> I like building a corporate hiearchy and that this is a pure strategy game with no luck. It is kind of like a themed Abstract Strategy Game. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://www.socialhourgames.com/railroads/">Railroads</a></td><td> I liked the negootiations and partial mergers. As the game went on us players would spend a lot discussing potential moves with each other and all of the actions and moves were meaningful. </td></tr>
