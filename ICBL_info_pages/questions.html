<h1>Questions on my Mind</h1>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>How can we provide people with the opportunity to learn more knowledge as the sum of humanity's knowledge continues to increase?</li>
<li>As the knowledge increases, how do we educated people to be competitive in modern society, without burdening them with a sufficient amount of external stress that they are incentivised to care more about being competitive than the implications of their thinking on the progress of humanity?</li>
<li>What is the place in science, or the education of science for subjectivity? How may we allow people to learn knowledge through more subjective projects of personal interest, while scaffolding the process to ensure that the learning objectives are met? For instance, how could the next me go through school and be able to explore materials by implementing the fundamentals of material modeling for their favorite materials or learn about image signals by crafting an image that could only be made with knowledge of signal anatomy.</li>
<li>How can we support individual work processes and prepare people to advocate for their prefered work styles, while being able to reflect and evaluate new work styles and arguments as they come in.
</ul>
