I received a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship to develop this program, which allows linear algebra students to solve computational problems at the granularity of row, column, and matrix operations, rather than repetitive arithmetic. Please see <a href="http://bryce-summers.github.io/old_dinosaurs/Project_Pages/SummersCAMP.html">here</a> for more information about this project.

<td><b>Hump Yard.</b><br>
Hump Yard is a board game about data structures and algorithms in the context of a rail classification yard. I've been developing it ever since I worked at Union Pacific Railroad in the Summer of 2014. I iterated on it over 30 times in the summer of 2017 and have exhibited it at the <a href="https://www.gencon.com/">Gen Con</a> Adventure Gaming convention in Indianapolis. I also received the 2014 - 2015 <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/award/index.html">Henry Armero Award</a> to help fund the original prototypes.
<br>
Please see <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5BOQDCTrjlGSlNybGl6NWlaWnM">here</a> for an example rules document that is out of date, but none the less should shed some light on the mechanics of the game.

I am working with New York University Transportation Engineers to create Sim Urban, a computer game about multi-modal transportation networks. We plan to someday use the game as an academic competition for students as well as a tool for informing the general public whose lives are affected by transportation, but whom have not received any formal training in the subject. <br><br>
I am currently working on a journal article describing a survey instrument that may be used to assess the effectiveness of a related class of games for stealth assesment.

<td><b>Graphics Diner.</b> Work in Progress.<br>
I have a dream of making the field of computer graphics more accessible through the creation of a graphic novel. I would also like it to be easier to produce compelling imagery about the various fields that computer graphics draws from, including perception, light, materiality, geometry, topology, and computer systems. <br>

This project is one of several that I've created on the theme of visualizing the structure and flow of executing programs. It shows the separation and connections between regions of memory while an algorithm is being executed. It also shows concepts such as scope and shadowing. I hope to make the next iteration in this line of inquiry based on the algorithms I'm developing with my Sim Urban project.

Over the past 6 years, I have been practicing the art of directly specifying images using mathematics. I use programming languages, text editors, and sometimes an integrated development environment. Please see <a href="http://bryce-summers.github.io/research/ComputationalSemiotics/topics/experimental_aesthetics.html">here</a> for a more detailed overview of a portion of my history in this endeavor and links to the code I've used to produce these images.

<td><b>Parrallel Painting</b>. At Carnegie Mellon University, I took a class on Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming numbered 15-418. I was so inspired by my teacher that I devised a parrallel painting scheme, where a group is given the task of painting the numbers 15-418, but they have to continually rotate canvases after every couple strokes. The results were a set of 4 images. <br>

As the precursor and first step towards my Graphics Diner research agenda, I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/">Keenan Crane</a> on the mathematics of computing sillhouette curves from subdivision surfaces. This mathematics is the first step in reconciling the divide between 3D modeling programs and 2D illustration programs and allowing educators to more efficiently illustrate ideas about geometry.

Given a set of planar polyline ‘scribble strokes’, creates a halfedge data structure representation of and then outputs the set of closed polyline loops constituting the negative space of the scribble strokes. Scribble.js also includes several other algorithms for segmented planar graphs, such as automatic coloring, edge deletion, bezier curves, and holes.

A project by Golan Levin, Chris Sugrue, and Kyle McDonald.
Originally exhibited at the Cinekid Festival MediaLab in Amsterdam. <br> <br>
I contributed a 2D boundary butterfly subdivision scheme using a directed acyclic stencil dependency graph, as well as a LAPACK reduction for hand deformation.
