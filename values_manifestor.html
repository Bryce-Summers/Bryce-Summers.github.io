<h1>Bryce's Personal Values Manifesto</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
I am a Computer Scientist and Artist who pursues three problems.
<ul>
<li><b>The awareness problem.</b> I make and support art that makes theoretical and abstract ideas part of the reality experienced by young people, because I don't want our species to die out when descision makers ignore these ideas when determinning our fate. I also want as many people as possible to have the opportunity to find intellectual hopes and dreams, that may carry them farther than dreams of money. </li>
<li><b>The Computer Science education problem.</b> For me these educational topics encompass the procedural topics in traditional institutionalized Computer Science,
computations on mathematical structures, the production of imagery that communicates meaning to humans, and generating meaningful imagery in related fields such as Transportation Engineering, Botany, Anthropology, Materials Science, Art, Furniture making, and philosophy.</li>
<li><b>The authorship problem.</b> Just like me, there are people out there with important ideas ranging from personal to universal that they want to share with the rest of us. I work to improve tools for self-expression and communication, because I want the young people and the old people to blow me away with their amazing ideas that I would never think of, because they've had a different life experience.</li>
</ul>

I believing in improving our solutions to these problems by whatever creative means necessary, be it though efficient algorithms to be implemented on a computer, social norms and game rules to be used in educational gameplay, beautiful storytelling, or making art. A computer scientist improves the tools that we use to solve problems. Improving tools doesn't need computers, programming, or even mathematics, sometimes it can be as simple as talking, painting, or taking out the trash in a new way. I will focus on the best ways to solve problems, rather than constraining myself to particular solution mediums.

</p>

<h2>Values Manifesto</h2>

<ul>
<li>I value providing children with a meaningful first 18 years to their existance, where they believe that their real life has already started.</li>
<li>I value openness in sharing one's ideas, values, and emotional motivations.</li>
<li>I value meaningful naming and using prescise language when helpful.</li>
<li>I value understanding the values of others.</li>
<li>I value bassoon playing and musical expression.</li>
<li>I value adventures of the mind fueled by intellectual wanderlust and curiosity, but I also value control of the self in the physical and social spheres of living.</li>
<li>I value dialogue about meanings. </li>
<li>I value friendship. A friend is someone who I can reproducibly spend time doing something meaningful with. A friend is a part of the science of the self.</li>
<li>I value my family and their ideas, even those that conflict with my own values. A family member is someone whom I reciprocally care for, sometimes without shared interests that would bring us into contact with each other otherwise. </li>
<li>I value people who cheerfully solve problems big and small, especially those who do so without computer science training, because they show me that I have a lot to learn about being a good person. </li>
<li> I value thinking about culture, which is the social rules we follow beyond the law. Social norms and cultural hegemony have made huge impacts on my life.</li>
<li> I value solving problems using Art. I value finding the best solutions to problems, even if they are novel, unexpected, or traditionally rejected.</li>
<li> I value rules. I value finding more meaningful, fun, empathetic, and useful rules, rather than blindly following the rules we are given.</li>
<li> I value the new, novel, and unexplored. I value competing with the ideas of my great predeccessor.</li>
<li> I value romanticism, where I give credit to people, objects, and environments in my life that provoke meaningful emotions that give meaning to my life.</li>
<li> I value people who choose not to limit their imagination by the tools they use or are given.</li>
<li> I value people who finish their work so that the next person with alternate skills will not be encumbered by the work the first person should have done.</li>
<li> I believe some people find nn interest that can drive them through life's challenges.</li>
<li> I believe the world is better and our species improved when these people are allowed to pursue their interest.</li>
<li> I believe Computer Sceince can improve human lives and is about the people.</li>
<li> I believe my feelings regarding Computer Science and Intellectualism should be shared with others through making art about Computer Science education and teaching.</li>
<li> I believe that making my art is the most important work that I could personally be doing and that it is the greatest contribution I can bring to our world.</li>
<li> I believe ideas and actions are more meaningful than money.</li>
<li> I believe programming is best done for joy and shared lovingly with others, such as with open source software.</li>
<li> I believe in openly sharing ideas with others, because I don't like it when people invent the same things due to secrecy.</li>
<li> I believe that if I ever program for money, then it must be done as a means towards my other values.</li>
<li> I believe that if I program for money, then I should choose work that is most aligned with my values.</li>
<li> I beleive that people who hold onto their deepest dreams can hold onto mental stability, and a feeling of being alive.</li>
<li> I believe in education and that knowledge gives people more power to self-determine the goals they pursue and the manner that they persue them.</li>
<li> I value leaders who provide goals, allow their expert followers to pursue those goals in the ways that work best for them based on their professional expertise and their personal preferences.</li>
<li> I believe that teaching should bee done with love for the student. I believe that a teacher should continuously improve their teaching to maximize the time spent learning the objective, minimizing the emotional costs for the student, and decompose the subject into pallatable logical leaps that work for the student. If a learning objective is of a higher order requiring lots of smaller previously learned steps like simple arithmetic, a computer should be used to perform the already learned actions so that the student can focus on the new actions they are trying to learn. This is the art of the elegant scalfolded computer game.</li>
<li> I believe in that is is ok for me to sell my time and physical objects. I don't believe in selling my ideas or intangible objects, rather I sell the time it took for me to develop those mental objects or the time it takes for me to support others in using those objects, such as by teaching.</li>
</ul>
