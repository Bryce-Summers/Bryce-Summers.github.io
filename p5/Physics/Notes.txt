Javascript does not really allow multiple functions with the same name, but different type signatures. This is rather annoying.

Although javascript does not send off syntax errors immediatly, it is programmer friendly enough for my to make progress.


Javascript does not use integer division!!! Beware the omniprescience of floating point numbers and use the Math.floor() function.





Visuals:

The Sketch maintains the proper bounds to the visual region as specified in the dimensions specification picture.

Each visualization is responsible for maintaining the properly sized divide if they wish to display 2 animations, instead of 1.

Visuals take 4 parameters to their draw function.
